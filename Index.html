            <p>Maybe you remember me, or maybe you don't, but we had a little interaction back then.</p>
            <p>We had a high five when you wanted to go out with your friends.</p>
            <p>To be clear, im the one who wearing glasses and white shirt at that time hahaha.</p> <br>
            <p>Maybe for you our interaction at that time was just an ordinary thing. <br> 
               But for me, who has admired you for the last past month, that moment felt truly extraordinary.</p><br>
            <p>I can't lie, from that moment on, my heart melted. I fell in love.</p>
            <p>Sorry if I'm being a wierdo for doing strange things like this, but for now, this is the only way I can express my feelings...</p>
